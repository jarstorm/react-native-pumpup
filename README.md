Tested on:
 - IOS Simulator
 - Android device
 
 
 TODO:
 - Profile component is not 100% correct. Read more text is not inline with the text
 - Images swiper. I used a library (react-native-swiper) and not a hand-made component. You cannot click on the buttons at the bottom
 - Popular photos gallery are not finished. When you change the orientation it doesn resize. I know that it's because you need to change the data inside the FlatList
 - I'm not using reselect. I need to learn why I need it and how to use.
 - Need to do more testing. There are a couple of examples
 - Need to follow your style guide
